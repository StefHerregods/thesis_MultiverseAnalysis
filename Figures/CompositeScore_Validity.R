# Generates heat map based on simulated data
# Composite score validity vs. 'percentage additional information'

## To do:
# Is main level of low validity item important?
# Is main level of high validity items important?
# Heat map should be with two separate colors, not continuous
# Also add continuous figure? Because maybe when bad, it's very bad (and when good, not such a big bonus)


# 1. Simulating data

# Low validity item


# High validity items


# 2. Calculate composite scores (with and without low validity item)

# 3. Calculate composite score validity for both composite scores

# 4. Create figure
